# Face_matching
The data used here is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sushilyadav1998/bollywood-celeb-localized-face-dataset from kaggle
Here in this project VGGFACE model has been used for the matching of face or basically by comparing the features of the detected face by the mtcnn model that has been imported. 
VGGFace is a pre-trained deep learning model designed for face recognition and face verification tasks. It is trained on a large dataset of faces and can extract features from images of faces that are useful for these tasks.
ResNet-50 (Residual Network with 50 layers) is one of the most popular deep learning architectures, especially for image recognition tasks. It introduces residual learning, which helps in training very deep networks by allowing the model to learn residuals (differences) instead of trying to learn unreferenced functions. This helps mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients and enables the training of deeper networks effectively.
When we specify model='resnet50', we are choosing to use the ResNet-50 architecture as the feature extractor within the VGGFace model. The ResNet-50 model will process the input images and output a set of features that represent the image in a lower-dimensional space.
The include_top=False argument means that the final fully connected layers (often used for classification) are excluded, leaving only the convolutional base of the ResNet-50 model. This allows us to use the model as a feature extractor for our specific task, rather than for classification.
The pooling='avg' argument specifies that global average pooling should be applied to the output of the last convolutional block of ResNet-50. This reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps, resulting in a single vector of features that can be used as input to other layers or models.
